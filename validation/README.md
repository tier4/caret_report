## How to use

- Run the following commands
  - Make sure to modify settings for your usage and environment
  - Make sure to prepare setting files
- `val_{dir_name_of_trace_data}` is created
- Open `index.html` to see a report

```sh
# Settings: modify for your usage and environment
export script_path=`pwd`/../validation        # Path to 'validation' directory in this repo cloned
export component_list_json=./component_list.json    # Path to setting file you prepare
export trace_data=~/.ros/tracing/caret_sample/      # Path to CARET trace data (CTF file)
export start_strip=10                               # strip time at the start [sec] for analysis
export end_strip=5                                  # strip time at the end [sec] for analysis
export callback_list_csv=./callback_list.csv
export topic_list_csv=./topic_list.csv
export note_text_top=./note_text_top.txt
export note_text_bottom=./note_text_bottom.txt

# Run script
sh ${script_path}/make_report.sh
```

## How to update callback_list.csv and topic_list.csv

- These lists should be updated as a target application changes
- The following files will be generated to update these files easily
  - callback_list_new.csv: callbacks which are used in the trace data but not listed in callback_list.csv
  - callback_list_deleted.csv: callbacks which are not found or not used in the trace data
  - topic_list_new.csv: topics which are used in the trace data but not listed in topic_list.csv
  - topic_list_unknown.csv: topics which are not found in the trace data
  - topic_list_deleted.csv: topics which are not found or not used in the trace data
